					One of the shareholders, veteran stockbroker
					Chandulal Shah, wants minority stakeholders to pull
					the plug on the proposed takeover of Carbacid
					Investment by BOC Kenya.
				</p>
				<p>
					The deal fell into trouble after Alliance Nominees,
					associated with the family of politician Kenneth
					Matiba, declined to endorse the merger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alliance holds a 22 per cent stake in Carbacid.
					While Capital Markets Authority Tribunal ruled in
					favour of a hook-up, regulator CMA resorted to High
					Court seeking relief over the deal. The matter is
					still pending, occasioning great loss to
					shareholders, according to Mr Shah.
				</p>
				<p>
					"BOC should withdraw from the process and start
					afresh," he said yesterday at Nation Centre,
					Nairobi. Mr Shah, a financial consultant - who
					founded suspended brokerage Shah Munge &amp;
					Partners, but withdrew years before it got into
					trouble - has written to Specialist Corporate
					Consultants seeking the release of shares jointly
					held with his wife, Shantaben.
				</p>
				<p>
					The letter tells the BOC registrars: "As you are
					aware, your holding our shares is greatly
					inconveniencing us and other shareholders of
					Carbacid Investment. Since the shares were lodged
					with you, we have been unable to trade in our
					shares."
				</p>
				<p>
					He hopes other shareholders will emulate his action
					and force the companies to halt the process. The
					court process is likely to be painfully slow, he
					says, and further inconvenience shareholders,
					especially those who only invested in Carbacid. Mr
					Shah is one of the most prominent portfolio
					investors in Kenya, with a stake in many listed
					companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Carbacid, he and his wife own 6,500 shares and
					another 1,000 in BOC. He is quick to point out that
					he is in favour of the process endorsed by most
					shareholders, but none had anticipated it "would
					take for ever before materialising". He further
					notes that Carbacid's performance has been
					improving, a fact that should favour a fresh
					process.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Comparatively, other share prices in the Nairobi
					Stock Exchange have since doubled or tripled their
					prices. We, shareholders of Carbacid, have really
					lost a lot and we want to be set free from this
					situation," the letter copied to CMA chief
					executive, directors of the two companies and NSE
					says in part.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is dated August 24. The NSE has in the last five
					years boomed with some shares going up by a factor
					of 10.
