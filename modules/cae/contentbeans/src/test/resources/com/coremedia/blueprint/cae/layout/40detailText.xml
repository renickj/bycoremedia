    London's vast urban area is often described
    using a set of district names (e.g. Bloomsbury,
    Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Whitechapel, Fitzrovia).
    These are either informal designations, or
    reflect the names of superseded villages,
    parishes and city wards. Such names have
    remained in use through tradition, each referring
    to a neighbourhood with its own distinctive
    character, but often with no modern official
    boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has
    been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition
    to the ancient City of London.
