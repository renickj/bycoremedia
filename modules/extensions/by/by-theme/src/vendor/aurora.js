/**

* Includes all javascripts required for theme aurora

* (this file is a placeholder, the inclusion is defined in exported content)

*

* To be able to use javascript frameworks without conflicts, we first include all vendor

* specific javascripts of all themes in the order they need to be loaded (e.g. basic-vendor.js, perfectchef-vendor.js)

*

* After all vendor specific javascript is loaded, coremedia specific javascript is being loaded.

* All coremedia specific javascripts access javascript frameworks via an own namespace. So the first javascript loaded

* will perform all actions necessary to avoid conflicts (e.g. if jQuery is being used call noConflict(true) in store

* the result in the namespace to be used.
