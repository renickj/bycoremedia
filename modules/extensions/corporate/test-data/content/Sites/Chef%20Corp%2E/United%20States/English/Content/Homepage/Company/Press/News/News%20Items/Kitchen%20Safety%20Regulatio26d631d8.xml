<detailText grammarName="coremedia-richtext-1.0"><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>On June 1st, new safety regulations for professional restaurant kitchens enacted by the European Commission will come into effect. The regulations cover two main areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen Drainage</strong><br/>Kitchens with more than 10m<sup>2</sup> will be required to have a floor drain with a fluid siphon pump with a capacity of no less than 10m<sup>3</sup> per minute.<br/>Kitchens with more than 30m<sup>2</sup> will be required to have a floor drain with a fluid siphon pump with a capacity of no less than 25m<sup>3</sup> per minute.<br/>Chef Corp. is proud to announce that <strong>all Chef Corp. kitchens that have been installed after 1997 already comply</strong> to this regulation. Even before then, our customers and kitchen designers have thought it necessary to include powerful drainage systems that are able to clear away all fluids in case of a mishap that could otherwise lead to harm.</li><li><strong>Space Requirements</strong><br/>Every employee who works in a kitchen must have a workstation of at least 1m<sup>2</sup> and free elbowroom of at least 2m<sup>2</sup>.  This includes all chefs de partie and butchers.<br/>Again, Chef Corp. customers who have acquired a Chef Corp. kitchen after 1997 are usually on the safe side. Our internal design requirements as well as our customers' wishes have seen to that. However, a small percentage of customers who had our kitchens fitted to the tiniest of restaurants are advised to review their Chef Corp. Kitchen Design and Delivery Document which contains this information.</li></ul><p>Chef Corp. customers who's kitchens do not comply and who are on the lifetime service plan can look forward to the usual low rates of our extended maintenance service to make their kitchens compliant to regulation. We are happy to help out our other customers and prospects as well. Call our service representative to find out how easy and painless we can help you get your restaurant up to code.</p></div></detailText>
