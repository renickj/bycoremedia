Sustainability is important to making sure that we have and will continue to have water, materials, and resources to protect our environment and in turn human health. Sustainability creates and maintains the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.</p><p><br/></p><p class="p--heading-2">How does Chef Corp. ensure sustainability of its business and operations?</p><p>We believe that the world in which we all live is meant to be enjoyed by all - also by our children and their children. Thus we ensure that all our products are manufactured to the highest ecological standards, minimizing wastage of energy and ressources as well as avoiding pollution of the environment. Our production plants are solar-powered and have extensive waste water filtering systems. By 2022, we aim to reach a zero-carbon-footprint for all our manufacturing. Our appliances are extremely energy efficient - with certification by agencies like the EPA in the United states - and ergonomically designed.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Hippie disclosure edible gardens PLCA rising sea levels Limits To Growth animals GHGE small island states World Summit on Sustainable Development aquaculture AccountAbility1000 ecosystem Johannesburg externality Gaia volunteering EMAS ecovillage women EFQM the animals save the planet GPP carsharing The Commons trust Rio codex GIY (grow it yourself) culture complexity WBCSD certificate organic Civil Society slow wine carbon trading worldchanging Bellagio Principles youth carrying capacity treehugger justice lifestyles closed loop locavore leadership coherence SRI conservation Natural Step precautionary principle The BioDaVersity Code opensource Green Belt Movement carpools agroforestry sustainable development fresh Caux Round Table Principles for Business foodsystem green angels thinktank integrity Ethical Trading Initiative interdependence Downshifters human rights The Amazon organism urban agriculture mindful people meaningful work SPP mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the greenest of them all?</p><p>Biomimicry Al Gore rebound effect Our Common Future less aesthetics more ethics FSC anthropocene SIGMA Guidelines land-grabbing CSR activism LOVOS artisan WRAP biodiversity C2C bicycle LED biocapacity ILO-OSH-MS biocentric IPCC social change environmental CERES earth WCED equity Rio+20 minimum wage education4sustainability Terra Madre animal welfare e-car Small Is Beautiful coral reef slow baking zero waste freegan long-term fair solidarity re-examine Gross Domestic Happiness footprint taste-the-waste foodcoops transparency scenarios ecosystem services liftclub time</p><p>Local hero The Keidanren Charter for Good Corporate Behaviour quality of life MDG anthropocentric EVOKE alternatives GRI adaptation NGO aid LCA access MSC accountability CSA heritage and heirloom foods No Impact Project ecoliteracy work-life-balance Silent Spring empower IUCN educate Equator Principles sustainable consumption &amp;
