A great place to see - impressive details all over. Place was a bit crowded, but we had a good time there
A most convincing display of why you should not simply demolish old buildings in a city and put up modern monstrosities. Big thumbs up for preserving this gem in the center of their city. All the lovely flowers, ponds, trees, bushes and in the summertimes the nice chairs to rest in.
Has anyone ever been there and want to share some tips where to go and what to do?
I simply love travelling and would really enjoy going there. Hope I can make this work for my next vacation!
Nope, this place is awful!!!
The city is developing into a major attraction and surely worth a visit.
The flight to go there takes really long, but the trip was well worth it.
This must be an excellent place in the summer to relax, for jogging, lunch, etc.
Yes, this place is wonderful!
This place is well worth it to see on a tour
Whenever you feel homesick, just go to McDonalds. You can find them all over the place there.
