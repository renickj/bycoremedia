<detailText grammarName="coremedia-richtext-1.0"><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Go to a place where you're not going to be stressed, because a honeymoon itself can be a stressful thing. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. You're only as good as your last collection, which is an enormous pressure. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. Confidence. If you have it, you can make anything look good.</p><p>I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want. There are always protests, whether you do something good or bad. Even if you do something beneficial, people say you do it because it's advertising. Dressing is a way of life. It's sometimes said that I'm rebellious and I do things to push people's buttons, but I just like the challenge. What I hate is nasty, ugly people.</p><p>Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them. Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. It's really easy to get colors right. It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but it's also an illusion. I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable.</p><p>Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. I'd like to believe that the women who wear my clothes are not dressing for other people, that they're wearing what they like and what suits them. It's not a status thing. I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Dressing is a way of life.</p><p>I'd like to believe that the women who wear my clothes are not dressing for other people, that they're wearing what they like and what suits them. It's not a status thing. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase. Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going - I have no post-satisfaction.</p><p>When I was young, I lived like an old woman, and when I got old, I had to live like a young person. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. I'm a fashion designer and people think, what do I know? Women are women, and hurray for that. I have my permanent muses and my muses of the moment.<br/></p></div></detailText>
