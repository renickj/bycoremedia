I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent. I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top. The difference between style and fashion is quality. Money doesn't buy elegance. You can take an inexpensive sheath, add a pretty scarf, gray shoes, and a wonderful bag, and it will always be elegant.</p><p/><p><a xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../Products/Fall%20Campaign/White%20Strap%20Dress%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Fall%20Campaign/White%20Strap%20Dress%20Product%20Teaser">Striped T-Shirt Product Teaser</a></p><p/><p>I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. I couldn't love a woman who inspired me to be totally disinterested. If I fell in love with a woman for an artistic reason, or from the point of view of my work, I think it would rob her of something. I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.</p><p>Delete the negative; accentuate the positive! We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. It has to be a world in which people live rather than die; a sustainable world. It could be great. I design from instinct. It's the only way I know how to live. What feels good. What feels right. What is needed. Give me a problem and I will approach it creatively, from my gut. Don't dress to kill, dress to survive. I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want.</p><p>Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul. Fashions fade, style is eternal. Women are women, and hurray for that. Fashion is made to become unfashionable. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same.</p><p>I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things. The difference between style and fashion is quality. I truly believe that philanthropy and commerce can work together. War taught me that not everything is glamorous. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish.</p><p>I was the first person to have a punk rock hairstyle. Luxury will be always around, no matter what happens in the world. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. You cannot be creative with people around you. Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose your fabrics depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you realize what you want it to be.</p></div></detailText>
