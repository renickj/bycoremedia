The key to making this a success is a little planning and preparation.

Note any dietary restrictions your guests may have and plan accordingly so nobody goes hungry.</p><p class="p--heading-3">Plan ahead</p><p>Once you’ve decided on the menu, make a list of everything you’ll need to buy. Ideally, shop for all the ingredients a day in advance. A few hours before guests arrive, review the recipe a few times and double-check that you have everything you need. You don’t want to leave your guests waiting while you run to the store for milk.</p><p><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Pictures/Magazine%20Pictures/Magazine%20Fall%20Pictures/Perfect%20Dinna2506378.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Pictures/Magazine%20Pictures/Magazine%20Fall%20Pictures/Perfect%20Dinner/Perfect%20Dinner%2004%20Picture"/></p><p>Prepare as much of the meal ahead of time as possible to minimize stress and be able to enjoy your company.

It can be awkward sitting and waiting for the food to come. If you’ll be busy in the kitchen, have something for them to do.
