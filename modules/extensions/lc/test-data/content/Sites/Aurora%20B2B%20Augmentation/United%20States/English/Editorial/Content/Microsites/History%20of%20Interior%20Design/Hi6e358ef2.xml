<detailText grammarName="coremedia-richtext-1.0"><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building. The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture" xlink:type="simple">architecture</a> that has resulted from the development of industrial processes. The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession.</p><p>In ancient India, architects used to work as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in Indian mythology. Additionally, the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th century India.</p><p>Throughout the 17th and 18th century, and into the early 19th Century, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_decoration" xlink:type="simple">interior decoration</a> was the concern of the homemaker or, an employed <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upholsterer" xlink:type="simple">upholsterer</a> or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.<img alt="" class="float--left" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Sh8b618526.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Microsites/History%20of%20Interior%20Design/Shang%20Palace%20main%20dining%20hall%20Picture"/></p><p class="p--heading-3">Commercial interior design and management</p><p>In the mid- to late-19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class" xlink:type="simple">middle class</a> in <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_revolution" xlink:type="simple">industrial</a> countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture" xlink:type="simple">furniture</a> firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.</p><p>In the 1850s and 1860s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office" xlink:type="simple">offices</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel" xlink:type="simple">hotels</a>, and <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_building" xlink:type="simple">public buildings</a>, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_literature" xlink:type="simple">catalogs</a> with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.</p><p>As department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition" xlink:type="simple">exhibitions</a> in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring_%26_Gillow" xlink:type="simple">Waring &amp; Gillow</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Shoolbred" xlink:type="simple">James Shoolbred</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mintons" xlink:type="simple">Mintons</a> and Holland &amp; Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.</p><p>This type of firm emerged in America after the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" xlink:type="simple">Civil War</a>. The <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herter_Brothers" xlink:type="simple">Herter Brothers</a>, founded by two German emigre brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_decorator" xlink:type="simple">interior decorators</a>. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors and carpets and draperies.</p><p>A pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Jones_(architect)" xlink:type="simple">Owen Jones</a>, one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century. Jones first project was his most important - in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Paxton" xlink:type="simple">Joseph Paxton</a>’s gigantic <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace" xlink:type="simple">Crystal Palace</a> for the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Exhibition" xlink:type="simple">Great Exhibition</a>, but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory" xlink:type="simple">controversial palette</a> of red, yellow and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" xlink:type="simple">Queen Victoria</a> to much critical acclaim. His most significant work was The Grammar of Ornament(1856), in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.</p><p>Jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson &amp; Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Morrison" xlink:type="simple">Alfred Morrison</a> and the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedive" xlink:type="simple">Khedive</a> of Egypt, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha" xlink:type="simple">Ismail Pasha</a>.</p><p>In 1882 the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly%27s_Directory" xlink:type="simple">London Directory</a> of the <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office" xlink:type="simple">Post Office</a> listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dibblee_Crace" xlink:type="simple">Crace</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring_%26_Gillow" xlink:type="simple">Waring &amp; Gillow</a> and Holland &amp; Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms, included <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edward_Collcutt" xlink:type="simple">Thomas Edward Collcutt</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_William_Godwin" xlink:type="simple">Edward William Godwin</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barry" xlink:type="simple">Charles Barry</a>, <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Semper" xlink:type="simple">Gottfried Semper</a> and <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Edmund_Street" xlink:type="simple">George Edmund Street</a>.</p><p><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Elb4350dd4.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Microsites/History%20of%20Interior%20Design/Electric%20wire%20reel%20reused%20in%20a%20furniture%20ecodesign%20Picture"/></p><p class="p--heading-3">Transition to professional interior design</p><p>By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" xlink:type="simple">feminist</a> author <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Haweis" xlink:type="simple">Mary Haweis</a> wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers. She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:</p><p>One of my strongest convictions, and one of the first canons of good taste, is that our houses, like the fish’s shell and the bird’s nest, ought to represent our individual taste and habits.</p><p>The move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dibblee_Crace" xlink:type="simple">John Dibblee Crace</a> as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country. By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of <a xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris" xlink:type="simple">William Morris</a>. In 1876, their work -Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.</p><p>Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.</p></div></detailText>
