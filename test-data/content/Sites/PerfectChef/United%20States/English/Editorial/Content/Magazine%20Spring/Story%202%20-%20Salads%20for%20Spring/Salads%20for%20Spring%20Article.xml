A spring salad can be as simple as tender greens tossed with vinaigrette, or you can step it up by adding seasonal treats like snap peas, asparagus, radishes, rhubarb, baby artichokes, and more fresh spring vegetables.</p><p>Eating Seasonally</p><p>Spring brings a bounty of fruits and vegetables in every color of the rainbow. As it approaches, there’s nothing we look forward to more than the coming weeks of warmer weather, longer days, and – most importantly – markets full of spring produce. </p><p><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Pictures/Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Avocado%20with%20Shrimp%20Appetizer%20Picture.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Pictures/Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Avocado%20with%20Shrimp%20Appetizer%20Picture"/></p><p>In grocers’ and farmers’ markets around the country, signs of spring are all around. Make good use of the fresh, vibrant new vegetables and fruits.</p><p class="p--heading-3">What’s in a Salad?</p><p><a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Navigation/Categories/05_Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Salads/Salads%20Spring%20Page.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Navigation/Categories/05_Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Salads/Salads%20Spring%20Page">Salads</a> are among the easiest and quickest dishes to prepare. Anything you want to call a salad is a salad, from canned tuna mixed with a jar of mayonnaise to a variety of exotic greens tossed with oil and vinegar. Because salads are so versatile, many ingredients can be prepared in advance, and leftovers can be thrown into the mix.</p><p/><p class="p--heading-3">Leafy Greens</p><p>These days, even average supermarkets have a good assortment of greens, and it always pays to combine at least two or three – preferably more – with varying flavors and textures. There are literally hundreds of edible green, leafy vegetables, and each has its own personality.</p><p><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Pictures/Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Garden%20Salad%20Picture.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Pictures/Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Garden%20Salad%20Picture"/></p><p>Arugula, Bibb lettuce, Boston lettuce, mache, and mesclun are available year-round but thrive in the cooler weather of spring and fall. Be sure to choose crisp lettuces free of blemishes. The leaves should be bright and fresh-looking. Lettuce should be washed and thoroughly dried in a salad spinner to remove any excess moisture. Refrigerate washed-and-dried greens in an airtight plastic bag for three to five days.</p><p class="p--heading-3">Simple Additions</p><p>Try adding a few of these easy, delicious ingredients to any salad for extra flavor, color, and texture.</p><ul><li>Fresh herbs, chopped or torn into small pieces</li><li>Nuts or seeds, crumbled or chopped if necessary</li><li>Sliced pears, apples, strawberries, grapes, or other fruit</li><li>Section citrus fruit, such as grapefruit or orange</li><li>Very thinly sliced Parmesan (use a vegetable peeler to produce them curls) or other hard cheese</li><li>Diced roasted red or yellow peppers (or canned pimentos), olives, capers, or anchovies</li><li>Finely cut celery or fennel</li><li>Crumbled hard-boiled egg</li></ul><p class="p--heading-3">Getting Creative</p><p>Embrace the fresh vegetables of spring by creating a healthy side salad or hearty main-dish salad of your own. Now that you know the salad basics, experiment by combining a few of your favorite fresh ingredients. The amount of delicious creations you can come up with is as endless as your imagination, so go ahead and have some fun with it.</p><blockquote><p class="p--heading-3">We like …</p><p>Here are some items we like to highlight your <a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Navigation/Categories/05_Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Salads/Salads%20Spring%20Page.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Navigation/Categories/05_Recipes/Spring%20Recipes/Salads/Salads%20Spring%20Page">delicious salads.</a></p><p><a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Products/Fall%20Campaign/Square%20Plate%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Fall%20Campaign/Square%20Plate%20Product%20Teaser"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Pictures/Product%20Pictures/01_On%20The%20Table/Plates%2C%20Tableware/PC_SQUARE_PLATE%20Frontshot.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Pictures/Product%20Pictures/01_On%20The%20Table/Plates%2C%20Tableware/PC_SQUARE_PLATE%20Frontshot"/></a></p><p><a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Products/Fall%20Campaign/Square%20Plate%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Fall%20Campaign/Square%20Plate%20Product%20Teaser">Square Rimmed Plates</a> - Ideal for enhancing a colorful spring salad, these plates make an elegant presentation.</p><p><a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Products/Spring%20Campaign/Cutlery%20Set%20Yellow%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Spring%20Campaign/Cutlery%20Set%20Yellow%20Product%20Teaser"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../../Pictures/Product%20Pictures/01_On%20The%20Table/Plates%2C%20Tableware/PC_CUTLERY_SET_YELLOW%20Frontshot.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Pictures/Product%20Pictures/01_On%20The%20Table/Plates%2C%20Tableware/PC_CUTLERY_SET_YELLOW%20Frontshot"/></a></p><p><a xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Products/Spring%20Campaign/Cutlery%20Set%20Yellow%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/PerfectChef/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Spring%20Campaign/Cutlery%20Set%20Yellow%20Product%20Teaser">Cutlery Set</a> - Sleek and modern, this lustrous yellow 24-piece cutlery set for six is maintains its polished quality with the highest-grade stainless steel.</p></blockquote></div></detailText>
